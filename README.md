# SyllableCounter.py

A fairly light and simple Python syllable counter. Created mainly for use with proper names and words that could not be found in a dictionary. It's farily accurate and _can_ work for common defined words by simply passing in an argument, allthough it's accuracy is only very lightly tested.
